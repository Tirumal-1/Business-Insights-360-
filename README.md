This project focuses on delivering actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard, built to assist AtliQ Hardware in making data-driven decisions. The dashboard integrates data from over 11+ tables, providing a comprehensive view of key business areas like finance, sales, and customer performance. With custom visualizations, DAX measures, and Power Query for data transformation, this dashboard simplifies the analysis of KPIs such as Net Sales, Gross Margin %, and Customer Trends.

The dashboard includes:

Sales Overview: Visual insights into sales performance, growth rates, and top-performing products.

Customer Insights: Analysis of customer behavior and revenue trends to enhance decision-making.

Supply Chain Analytics: Monitoring supply chain variances and operational efficiency for improved logistics.
